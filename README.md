####  Heart_Failure
#### Project Status: Completed

#### Project Description
The dataset was gotten from Kaggle. The dataset was used to predict whether a patient is prone to heart failure depending on multiple attributes.

#### Machine Learning Algorithms used include:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
- For the decision tree classification model, I optimized the model using the gini index and entropy. 
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

* The model was evaluated using the confusion matrix, area under the curve and by checking the model accuracy.
